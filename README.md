# Dark-Dungeon-Adventure-Game

This is the first Unity game I made with C#. It is a text based adventure game focusing on escaping from a dungeon. 
I made this as part of the C# Unity Course held at https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/.

You can either take the path of the rogue, the wizard, or the warrior in order to escape.

You can play the game easily at https://moondawg422.itch.io/the-dark-dungeon. Enjoy!
